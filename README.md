# Description
This application is created to implement CRUD functions. The application retrieves Monitors and their respected information in a SQL database. A table of Monitors is displayed on the home page. The user will be able to view some of the monitors properties (make, model and screen-size). The user will have access to create a new item, which will then be added to the database. The user will also be able to edit or remove a monitor of their choosing.

# Technologies Used
JAVA, SQL, Eclipse, Gradle, CSS, MYSQL Workbench, GIT.

# Lessons Learned
While building this project, I learned how to create a database, link the database, and retrieve information.
